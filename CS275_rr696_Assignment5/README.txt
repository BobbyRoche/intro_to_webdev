CS275 Assignment 5


This program's purpose is to use a SQL database to display various graphs of student information.

To run the program, run the server by opening the command line or terminal and navigating to the directory of the 
project folder. Then type 'node server.js'. You should be notified it is running. 

Then type 'http://localhost:8080/hw5'into the browser search bar (chrome was used for this project).

Use the top dropdown and button to display singular graphs on student, course, and grade information.

Use the bottom dropdown to display transcripts from various times of various students by using the dropdowns and pressing submit.

The bottom text fields are used to enter new students into the database. As per the instructions only students need to be entered, no grades
or additional information. Simply fill out the text fields and click the button. You will be notified on the result of the query.

I am still new to SQL, or if you need me to send the database over please let me know. I included my commands for creating the database in the SQL subdirectory of this project's folder.
